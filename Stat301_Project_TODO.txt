STAT 301 Project - TODO
=================================

 Dataset & Hypotheses
-----------------------------------
[X] Identify and select a dataset appropriate for ANOVA
    - Chose hockey dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xavya77/nhl04to18
[X] Clean the dataset (remove missing or irrelevant values)
    - Condensed player positions down to a sinlge position
    - Elimated players with less than 30 games played
[X] Choose at least two research questions that can be answered with ANOVA
    - Q1: Does player position have an effect on point production
    - Q2: Does player position and age group have an effect on point production
[X] Select appropriate variables for each question
    - Q1: IV = Player position
          DV = Point production
    - Q2: IV = Player position, Player Age Group
          DV = Point production
[X] Formulate null and alternative hypotheses for each question

Data Analysis (Methods Section)
-----------------------------------
[X] Select the correct ANOVA method(s) (one-way, two-way, etc.)
[X] Justify why the selected ANOVA method is appropriate
[X] Process and clean data as needed
[X] Run ANOVA tests in R or another statistical tool
[X] Record all test statistics and p-values
